This instructions are for Red Hat based OS:

	1.	Install and configure RabbitMQ (Follow this instructions http://www.rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html)
		1.1	For this, you must enable the use of the EPEL repository. Then, install Erlang by doing the following
			command as sudo
		 	'yum install erlang'
		1.2 Add the RabbitMQ repository, and install RabbitMQ
			'rpm --import http://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-signing-key-public.asc'
      		'yum install rabbitmq-server-3.4.4-1.noarch.rpm'
      	1.3	Start the server by doing:
      		'/sbin/service rabbitmq-server start'
      		'rabbitmqctl star_app'
      	1.4 Enable the rabbitmq_management plugin, which will allow you to easily configure the server.
      		To do this you must execute:
      			'/usr/lib/rabbitmq/bin/rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management'
      		Then restart RabbitMQ:
      			'/sbin/service rabbitmq-server restart'
      			'rabbitmqctl stop_app'
      			'rabbitmqctl star_app'
      	1.5 Open a browser and go to 'localhost:15672' with user/pass => guest/guest/
      		At the bottom of the page, use the 'Import definitions' to Upload the conf file provided in this repository
      		in 'Hermes/RabbitConfig/rabbit_basic_conf.json'. This will create a basic configuration with a new
      		administrative user called 'alma' with the default password 'samuraijack'. It will also disable the
      		administrative rights of guest, so the next time you log in, do it as 'alma'. It will also create a exchange
      		called 'alma_events', a queue called 'alma_events_queue' with routing_key 'AlmaEven', binding the queue to
      		the 'alma_events' exchange.
      		**************************REMEMBER TO CHANGE THE DEFAULT PASSWORD!!*****************************************
	2.	Install and Configure Logstash:
		2.1	Add the logstash repository:
			'rpm --import http://packages.elasticsearch.org/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch'
			Copy the the file 'logstash.repo' from 'Hermes/Logstash' to '/etc/yum.repos.d/'
		2.2 Install Logstash:
			'yum install logstash'
		2.3 Add configuration files to Logstash. For this copy the files '01-lumberjack-input.conf', '10-syslog.conf'
			and '30-lumberjack-output.conf' from 'Hermes/Logstash' to '/etc/logstash/conf.d/'
	3. 	Install ElasticSearch
		3.1 Download the RMP from their page:
			'wget https://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.4.3.noarch.rpm'
		3.2 Install Elasticsearch:
			'rmp -iv elasticsearch-1.4.3.noarch.rpm'
		3.3 Make ElasticSearch autostart and then start it:
			'/sbin/chkconfig --add elasticsearch'
			'service elasticsearch start'
		3.4 Configure ElasticSearch to accept Kibana, by adding the following line at the end of
			'/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml':
			'http.cors.enabled: true'
			Then restart the service:
			'service elasticsearch restart'
	4.	Install and setup Kibana. For this we will use Apache, which we suppose is installed in the machine
		4.1	In '/var/www/httml/' create a new directory:
			'mkdir Kibana' then 'cd Kibana/'
		4.2	Extract and delete the unnecessary files and folders:
		 	'tar -zxvf kibana-3.1.2.tar.gz'
		 	'cp -rf kibana-3.1.2/* .'
		 	'rm -rf kibana-3.1.2'
		 	'rm -rf kibana-3.1.2.tar/gz'
		4.3	Configure Kibana by pointing it to where your elasticsearch server is. To do this, modify the following line in 'config.js':
			From:
				'elasticsearch: "http://"+window.location.hostname+":9200",'
			To:
				'elasticsearch: "<URL of your ElasticSearch Server>
		4.4 Configure apache to serve Kibana. To do this, copy the Apache config file 'Kibana-Apache.conf' from
			'Hermes/Kibana/' to '/etc/httpd/conf.d/'. Then restart Apache with:
			'service httpd restart'

	Congratulations! You should now have an ELK stack configured on your server!
