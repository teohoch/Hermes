This instructions are for Red Hat based OS:

	1.	Install and configure RabbitMQ (Follow this instructions http://www.rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html)
		1.1	For this, you must enable the use of the EPEL repository. Then, install Erlang by doing the following
			command as sudo
		 	'yum install erlang'
		1.2 Add the RabbitMQ repository, and install RabbitMQ
			'rpm --import http://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-signing-key-public.asc'
      		'yum install rabbitmq-server-3.4.4-1.noarch.rpm'
      	1.3	Start the server by doing:
      		'/sbin/service rabbitmq-server start'
      		'rabbitmqctl star_app'
      	1.4 Enable the rabbitmq_management plugin, which will allow you to easily configure the server.
      		To do this you must execute:
      			'/usr/lib/rabbitmq/bin/rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management'
      		Then restart RabbitMQ:
      			'/sbin/service rabbitmq-server restart'
      			'rabbitmqctl stop_app'
      			'rabbitmqctl star_app'
      	1.5 Open a browser and go to 'localhost:15672' with user/pass => guest/guest/
      		At the bottom of the page, use the 'Import definitions' to Upload the conf file provided in this repository
      		in 'Hermes/RabbitConfig/rabbit_basic_conf.json'. This will create a basic configuration with a new
      		administrative user called 'alma' with the default password 'samuraijack'. It will also disable the
      		administrative rights of guest, so the next time you log in, do it as 'alma'. It will also create a exchange
      		called 'alma_events', a queue called 'alma_events_queue' with routing_key 'AlmaEven', binding the queue to
      		the 'alma_events' exchange.
      		**************************REMEMBER TO CHANGE THE DEFAULT PASSWORD!!*****************************************
	2.	Install and Configure Logstash:
		2.1	Add the logstash repository:
			'rpm --import http://packages.elasticsearch.org/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch'
			Copy the the file 'logstash.repo' from 'Hermes/Logstash' to '/etc/yum.repos.d/'
		2.2 Install Logstash:
			'yum install logstash'
		2.3 Add configuration files to Logstash. For this copy the files '01-lumberjack-input.conf', '10-syslog.conf'
			and '30-lumberjack-output.conf' from 'Hermes/Logstash' to '/etc/logstash/conf.d/'
	3. 	Install ElasticSearch
		3.1 Download and install the Public Signing Key for the Elasticsearch Repository
			'rpm --import https://packages.elasticsearch.org/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch'
		3.2 Copy the file 'Hermes/Elasticsearch/elasticsearch.repo' to the '/etc/yum.repos.d/' directory
		3.3 Update yum, and install elasticsearch:
			'yum update'
			'yum install elasticsearch'
		3.4 Set elasticsearch to autostart at boot by doing:
			'chkconfig --add elasticsearch'
		3.5 Start elasticsearch:
			'service elasticsearch start'
	4.	Install and setup Kibana3. For this we will use Apache, which we suppose is installed in the machine
		4.1	In '/var/www/httml/' create a new directory:
			'mkdir Kibana' then 'cd Kibana/'
		4.2	Extract and delete the unnecessary files and folders:
		 	'tar -zxvf kibana-3.1.2.tar.gz'
		 	'cp -rf kibana-3.1.2/* .'
		 	'rm -rf kibana-3.1.2'
		 	'rm -rf kibana-3.1.2.tar/gz'
		4.3	Configure Kibana by pointing it to where your elasticsearch server is. To do this, modify the following line in 'config.js':
			From:
				'elasticsearch: "http://"+window.location.hostname+":9200",'
			To:
				'elasticsearch: "<URL of your ElasticSearch Server>
		4.4 Configure apache to serve Kibana. To do this, copy the Apache config file 'Kibana-Apache.conf' from
			'Hermes/Kibana/' to '/etc/httpd/conf.d/'. Then restart Apache with:
			'service httpd restart'
	4. 	Or Install and setup Kibana4. For this we'll use the backend of Kibana and configure it as a service.
		4.1	In '/var/www/httml/' create a new directory:
			'mkdir Kibana' then 'cd Kibana/'
		4.2	Download Kibana. Depending in your OS download either the 32 bit version:
			'wget https://download.elasticsearch.org/kibana/kibana/kibana-4.0.0-linux-x86.tar.gz'
			or the 64 bit version:
			'wget https://download.elasticsearch.org/kibana/kibana/kibana-4.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz'
		4.3	Extract and delete the unnecessary files and folders:
		 	'tar -zxf kibana-4.0.0-linux-x**.tar.gz'
		 	'cp -rf kibana-4.0.0-linux-x**/* .'
		 	'rm -rf kibana-4.0.0-linux-x**'
		4.4	Configure Kibana by pointing it to where your elasticsearch server is. To do this, modify the following line
		 	in 'Kibana/config/kibana.yml':
			From:
				'elasticsearch: "http://"+window.location.hostname+":9200",'
			To:
				'elasticsearch: "<URL of your ElasticSearch Server>
		4.5 You can also configure the port at which Kibana will bind by modifying the line
				'Port: 5601'
			to the port of your choosing.
		4.5	Copy the file 'Hermes/Kibana/Kibana' to '/etc/init.d/' Thi will allow the use of Kibana as a linux Service:
			'cp Hermes/Kibaba/Kibana /etc/init.d/'
			if you followed points 4.2,4.2 and 4.4 to the letter, the configuration should work as it is.
		4.6 Add the Kibana service to autostart at boot:
			'update-rc.d kibana defaults'
		4.7 Start the service by doing:
			'service kibana start'

	Congratulations! You should now have an ELK stack configured on your server!
